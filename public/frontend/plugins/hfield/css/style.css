/* MyHoneyPot Styling 

USE THIS STYLESHEET TO FIT THE HONEYPOT STYLE TO YOUR THEME STYLE
Probably you will not be able to use 1 style for all different 
theme pages but you usually there is a style that fits best.

You don't have to change style for the plugin to work but it
can make a difference in case of more 'intelligent' bots.
